After purchasing your domain, you'll need to connect it to your Netlify-deployed website.

- Log in to your domain registrar (e.g., Niagahoster).
- Navigate to the DNS management or server name settings.

##### 9. Copy DNS Information from Netlify
On your Netlify site dashboard, go to the "Domain" tab to find the DNS settings.

##### 10. Update DNS Settings
Go back to your domain registrar's DNS settings and paste the copied DNS information into the appropriate fields.
